I maintain 3 formats of my résumé -- Word, HTML, and plain text.

This turns out to be not so simple, since there's no good way to automate the conversion between formats.
(The formatting ends up looking terrible.)
So I've decided that keeping the HTML and text versions in git will let me see the changes much more easily.
This way, I'll be able to easily see that the changes between all 3 formats are consistent.

Having my résumé in git will also help me track changes over time.
And it'll give me the possibility of "forking" my résumé for different purposes.
