I need to provide my résumé in several formats, due to requirements that
different companies have.

After several years of manually updating 3 different formats, I decided to
maintain and update only a Markdown version, and generate all the other
formats from that. I tried using MultiMarkdown at first, but then settled
on Pandoc's variant of Markdown, since Pandoc makes it easier to generate
more formats.

Having my résumé in git will also help me track changes over time. And
it will give me the possibility of "forking" my résumé for different
purposes.
