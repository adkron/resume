## Agile Practitioner | Thought Leader | Web & Embedded Developer

Agile software developer with 10+ years of success working with and
leading teams to develop quality software under changing requirements.
Able to rapidly utilize new, leading edge technologies. Proven track
record in developing trust with customers and within teams.

### Binary Noggin, Owner/Developer - St. James, MO August 2013 - Present

I work closely with customers as Agile practitioners to improve teams
and products.  I believe in building amazing software through an
understanding of the “why” in the product. I find this “why” through
constant communication and trust. Using test driven development and
continuous delivery of working software that exceeds expectations and
provides constant value is my priority.
