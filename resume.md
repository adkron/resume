Responsible for test driven development of Secure Naval Chat allowing XMPP, IRC, and an in house secure chat protocol to be utilized on the same server while minimizing wire traffic and retaining chat history for later recall by the client. Also responsible for the client software and customer interaction while spending two trips aboard US Naval vessels. Utilized Java, Mina, and Eclipse RCP from **2007 - 2008**

Developed internal Ruby on Rails application that handles accounting, project management, billing, employee management, time tracking, leave, etc. Responsible for keeping the site working with both Oracle and MySQL. Utilized TestUnit, Shoulda, and Webrat for test driven development. Used Prototype for UJS. **2008 - 2009**

Developed Spring MVC 3 application to help farmers maximize their profits through crop insurance and futures markets. Utilized Prototype and Low Pro for UJS. Worked with a legacy DB2 database. Instrumental in utilizing JRuby and Cucumber for UAT development, and spent time updating the

Developed logistics management and planning software as portlets utilizing jQuery, Spring MVC 3 Portlet, and Liferay for United States Transportation Command(USTC) while serving as an integrated member of a Composite Agile Development Team brining Agile Development to the DOD. During this time I designed and developed a language to allow the end users to write their own data validations. The language was affectionately named RAmos and is still used today to facilitate in planning transportation requirements for USTC. **December 2009 - September 2010**

Technical Lead/Developer for a social networking/data collecting site for users with type one diabetes and caregivers of type one diabetics. I lead the team through an indecisive customer with extreme deadlines while trying to keep team morale and code quality high. I acted as a developer at all times. Pairing with each developer throughout the entire process. We utilized Rails 3, MongoDB, HAML, SASS, RSpec, Cucumber and many other tools to ensure the product met and exceeded the customer’s expectations. **2010 - 2012**

Joined a team that had been creating a new operating system utilizing Ubuntu as a base and python-gtk. When I joined the team they were writing few tests and struggling with their code base. There was also a very neglected Ruby on Rails and Mongo statistics server. I helped rewrite the sever to meet the expectations of the client and the team while adhering to strict BDD. Improving the overall customer happiness and the team’s confidence in the product. After only being on the team a few weeks, and with no prior python experience, I began being a team goto python developer. I pushed the team to utilize good OO design principles and testing practices in order to increase the code understandability. The testing also helped others become more familiar with python itself as it gave them the ability to better explore the language. **2012 - 2013**
