  <p>I am responsible for growing the technical prowess and guiding
  ways to grow sustainable software while keeping customers
  delighted. I teach about software design, testing, and agile
  methodologies. I am also responsible for implementing customer
  requirements in software. This is a small company of nine
  employees and seven current projects. There are many challenges
  to being spread that thin so we all work on everything from
  design to implementation and deployment. My main technologies are
  Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Active::Record, Vagrant, Chef, SASS, HAML,
  Bootstrap, Bourbon, Neat, and whatever else is needed to get the
  job done.</p>

  <p>Joined a team that had been creating a new operating system
  utilizing Ubuntu as a base and python-gtk. When I joined the team

  expectations of the client and the team while adhering to strict
  BDD. Improving the overall customer happiness and the team's
  confidence in the product. After only being on the team a few
  weeks, and with no prior python experience, I began being a team
  goto python developer. I pushed the team to utilize good OO
  design principles and testing practices in order to increase the
  code understandability. The testing also helped others become
  more familiar with python itself as it gave them the ability to
  better explore the language. <strong>2012 - 2013</strong></p>
